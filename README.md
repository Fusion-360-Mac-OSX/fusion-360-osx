## What is Fusion 360?  

**Fusion 360** is a complete **3D modeling and engineering solution** that merges design, simulation, and manufacturing in a unified environment. It’s developed for professionals who demand precision, creative control, and seamless workflow integration — from concept to production.  

This powerful platform brings together the capabilities of **CAD (computer-aided design)**, **CAM (computer-aided manufacturing)**, and **CAE (computer-aided engineering)** under one roof. It allows you to model, test, and fabricate parts and assemblies within the same application — saving time and improving efficiency.  

Fusion 360 supports **parametric modeling**, **surface sculpting**, and **direct editing**, giving users flexibility for both technical and creative work. Its **cloud-based collaboration tools** enable teams to co-design projects, manage revisions, and share feedback in real time across different locations.  

The software also includes **AI-driven generative design**, producing optimized engineering solutions that balance material strength, performance, and cost. With its support for **Apple Silicon**, Fusion 360 runs faster, renders smoother, and handles complex 3D simulations effortlessly.  

Whether you’re designing mechanical components, developing prototypes, or running CNC operations, Fusion 360 provides everything needed for professional-grade digital manufacturing.
